              Time passes by slowly, but as we wait for time to come, life passes by. Live your life to the fullest to avoid regretting the present which will be the past you will reminisce in the future.

        <p class="phara1">Reminisce the memories of the last batch of Dignity student supervised by Ms. Romelyn Carbonilla.
            This is not the best section when it comes to academics but is proud to be one of the most behave sections in the campus.
            "This section was one of the most behave sections there is in the campus" said Ms. Carbonilla. We made many memories together as a class.
            There are moments when our bonds were tested and we overcame that challenges and made our bonds stronger and much more resilient. Ending of the grade 11 chapters of the students of this section was remarkable as it is the sign of accomplishment for overcoming this chapter. We move forward to a new chapter.

            This chapter of our life is about to end. We are now going to face a new challenge of having to adjust our looks in life. Letting go is part of life. We lose people and we meet new people in our life. This is a sign that we eventually meet new people, but some people always stays in our memories and heart. These are the people who we cherished and love the most. The memories of them are the happiest memories we had. These memories are unforgettable and can never be replaced.
